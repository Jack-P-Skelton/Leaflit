# Leaflit
Arkansas Coding Academy Demo Day Project

This is the first Full Stack Application I made on my own

Purpose
  Leaflit was designed for anyone who wants to garden or struggles to grow plants. The user is asked for their zipcode, sunlight in their yard, 
and the amount of time they have to spend in their garden. It will then return a list of plants from the Leaflit database to tell the user what they can grow in their own yard.

Features
- Discover what you can grow in your own back yard
- Return any random plant from the Leaflit database
- All CRUD functions are done through the Admin page
- Search the Leaflit data base for plants and their information
- Learn about Watering, Light, Soil, and Hardiness Zones
