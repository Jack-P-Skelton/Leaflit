		<h1>Get to know your soil.</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Dig into your garden and find out whether you have clay or sandy soil. It makes a big difference in your drainage. <br><br>
			Clay-laden soil presents special watering challenges. Clay has an electrical charge that draws water, pulling it away from plant roots. In dense clay, little room exists for passages that permit the exchange of essential gases with the air above ground. Clay also drains slowly.<br><br>		
			Water flows more easily through sandy soil. But if very sandy, water may leach out too quickly and take dissolved nutrients with it. Both clay and sandy soils can be turned into a preferred loam by mixing in organic material, such as compost.</h4>
		<br>
		<h1>Choose your time wisely.</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Early morning, late afternoon, and evening are usually best for watering because the cooler temperatures mean less water will evaporate. <br><br>
			Limiting your watering to these times is a particularly good idea if you use overhead sprinklers. Under bright sunshine, water droplets intensify the rays and can singe the leaves. It is also safer not to water at night, as the leaves will remain wet, which may encourage disease.<br><br>		
			In arid places, however, some people decide to risk night watering to give the water longer to soak into the soil and cut evaporation from the sun.</h4><br><br>
