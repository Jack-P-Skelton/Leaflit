		<br>						
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Knowing your growing zone is probably one of the most important pieces of knowledge in gardening, especially when it comes to plant shopping online. Plants are often referred to as hardy to a particular zone. <br><br>
			This means that they can survive in the lowest winter temperatures of that zone. You always want to choose plants that are recommended for your particular growing zone. This is a great way to get started on a planting path to success! <br></h4>

			<h4 class="font-weight-light">The USDA plant hardiness zone map was created by the United States Department of Agriculture to help gardeners, landscapers, and growers determine the best plants to grow in their area.<br><br>
			 Growing zones are based on average annual minimum winter temperatures and separated out by a margin of 10 degrees Fahrenheit. USDA growing zones range from 1 to 13, but the continental US only ranges from 3 to 10. <br><br>
			 The official USDA zone map is now further divided into subcategories of a and b with a 5 degree margin. Growing zones are sometimes referred to as planting zones or USDA hardiness zones. These all refer to the same United States zone map. So, growing zones are numbers that tell us how cold our winters can be. Plants are assigned growing zone recommendations.<br>
			  So, if you know your growing zone, you can determine if a particular plant is likely to grow well in your area.</h4><br><br>
