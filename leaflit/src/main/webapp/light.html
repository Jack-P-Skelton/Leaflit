		<br>
		<h1>Use vertical space</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Got a small sunny patch? Make the most of it by going vertical. You can fit more plants in a space when you think up and down rather than across. Vining plants are a great start. Use poles or trellises to train pole beans beans, cucumbers, peas, and climbing tomatoes to grow upward to get the sunlight they need.</h4>

		<h1>Portable raised beds are your friend</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Maybe you do get full sun in your yard - just not in the same area throughout the day. If your backyard is sunny in the morning while your front yard gets all the light in the afternoon and evening, for example, you can plant crops that require full sun, it will just require more labor on your part to make sure they get it. <br><br>
			There are a few ways to accomplish this: you can go as simple as flower pots in a wagon, or you can get handy and build raised beds with wheels from scratch. You can even buy them all ready to use.</h4>
		<br>
		<h1>Some plants do well in shade</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Learn to love veggies that don&#x27t require full sun to do well. Root vegetables typically don&#x27t need as much sunlight to thrive as others. Carrots, potatoes, beets, and radishes can do well with just four hours of sunlight.  <br><br>
			Leafy vegetables can produce with very little sun. Though not ideal, you can harvest plenty of lettuce, kale, and arugula with just 3 hours of sun, as long as the plants are well cared for. <br>
			Most herbs will also do just fine with limited sun. Perennials like rhubarb and asparagus can also thrive in shadier areas, so give those a go, too.</h4><br><br>
