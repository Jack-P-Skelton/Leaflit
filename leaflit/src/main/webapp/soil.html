		<br>
		<h1>Feed it an Organic Diet</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">We build soil health all year-round by feeding and caring for it. How? Living soil has the same four basic requirements we do: food, water, shelter, and air.<br><br>
			Autumn is the best season to start. Organic materials, the key ingredients for healthy soils, abound. You can add fallen leaves, garden debris, kitchen scraps, and even apples raked from beneath fruit trees to soil.<br>
			Chop organic material directly into the top 2 inches of soil with a heavy bladed hoe and cover with mulch. Ideally, add concentrated manures, mineral phosphorous and potassium fertilizers, and lime at the same time. Adding these materials in the fall gives them time to break down for use when plants need them in the spring.

		<br>
		<h1>Grow Your Own Soil</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Green manures and cover crops such as buckwheat and phacelia in the summertime and vetch, daikon, and clovers in the fall are my favorite way to improve soils. Whenever I have a window before planting, I grow a cover crop to add organic matter, lighten and loosen soil structure, and enrich garden nutrients. Cover crops also act as a living mulch to shelter soils and control weeds in the off-season. <br><br>
			Chop over-wintered cover crops directly into spring soils a few weeks before planting. During the growing season, sow a quick-growing cover crop, such as buckwheat, to fill the gap between spring and fall crops. When it&#x27s time to plant, pull the buckwheat cover and use it as a mulch for fall garden beds.</h4>
		<br>
		<h1>Test for Success</h1>
		<br>
		<h4 class="font-weight-light">Soil tests are an indispensable garden tool. I always recommend taking one when starting a new garden, or when garden health declines. If an essential nutrient is missing, garden and soil health will suffer. For best results, take nutrient tests in the late summer or early fall. Submit a soil test to a certified lab to add the right balance fertilizers and lime materials to new gardens.</h4><br><br>
